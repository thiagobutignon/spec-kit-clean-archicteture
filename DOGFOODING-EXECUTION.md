# REGENT CLI Dogfooding Execution Tracker

## üéØ Mission
Execute fresh REGENT CLI dogfooding with zero prior assumptions. Test real user onboarding experience and validate that the CLI provides seamless developer experience for Clean Architecture implementation.

## üë• Role Assignments
- **Fresh Dogfooder**: New Claude executor (zero context, fresh perspective)
- **Bug Mapper**: Current Claude (maps issues found during dogfooding, maintains BUG-MAPPING-REPORT.md)
- **Reviewer**: Continues PR reviews and maintains code quality

## üîß Environment Setup
### Pre-requisites
- [x] Uninstall existing `regent` globally: `npm uninstall -g regent`
- [x] Uninstall existing `spec-ca` globally: `npm uninstall -g spec-ca`
- [x] Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- [x] Install fresh REGENT: `npm install -g .` (from project root)

## üìã Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Initial CLI Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
- [x] Verify `regent --help` works
- [x] Test `regent --version`
- [x] List all available commands
- [x] Document first impressions and setup friction
- [x] Validate CLI can be found in PATH

**Expected Commands:**
- `/01-plan-layer-features`
- `/02-validate-layer-plan`
- `/03-generate-layer-code`
- `/06-execute-layer-steps`
- `/implement` (orchestrator)

### Phase 2: Project Initialization üöÄ
- [x] Run `regent init` on completely fresh project
- [x] Follow all prompts naturally (no shortcuts or expert knowledge)
- [x] Document user experience gaps and unclear messaging
- [x] Test generated project structure matches expectations
- [x] Verify .regent templates are properly initialized
- [x] Validate Clean Architecture folder structure creation
- [x] Test that all necessary dependencies are installed

**Critical Validation Points:**
- [x] .regent/templates/ directory created with all required templates (15 templates found)
- [x] .claude/commands/ directory populated with slash commands (all commands present)
- [x] package.json contains all necessary dependencies
- [x] TypeScript configuration properly set up
- [x] Clean Architecture layers properly scaffolded

**Observations:**
‚úÖ Project successfully created in `packages/dogfooding`
‚úÖ All templates installed (backend, frontend, fullstack)
‚úÖ Claude commands properly configured
‚úÖ Git repository initialized
‚ö†Ô∏è Created inside packages/ directory (not standalone)
üìù Next steps guidance provided clearly

### Phase 3: Clean Architecture Workflow üîÑ
- [x] Use `/01-plan-layer-features` for a real feature (suggest: user authentication)
- [ ] Execute `/02-validate-layer-plan` and verify validation works
- [ ] Run `/03-generate-layer-code` and check YAML output quality
- [ ] Complete `/06-execute-layer-steps` and monitor execution
- [ ] Document workflow friction points and unclear guidance
- [ ] Test error handling when steps fail
- [ ] Verify RLHF scoring provides meaningful feedback

**Workflow Validation:**
- [x] Plan ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Execute sequence works smoothly (Step 1 complete)
- [x] Each step provides clear feedback to user
- [ ] Error messages are actionable and helpful
- [ ] Generated code follows Clean Architecture principles
- [ ] RLHF scores accurately reflect code quality (-2 to +2 scale)

**Phase 3.1: /01-plan-layer-features Results**
‚úÖ Command executed successfully for "user authentication"
‚úÖ Generated comprehensive JSON plan at `spec/001-user-authentication/domain/plan.json`
‚úÖ Plan includes:
  - Ubiquitous Language definitions (7 terms)
  - Business Rules (4 rules)
  - 13 implementation steps
  - 6 high-level tasks (T001-T006)
  - Proper Clean Architecture structure
‚úÖ Clear next step guidance provided
‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed format: both "steps" and "tasks" arrays (may need clarification)

### Phase 4: Real Development Test üèóÔ∏è
- [ ] Implement actual feature using REGENT (not just examples)
- [ ] Follow Clean Architecture layer constraints strictly
- [ ] Test GitFlow enforcement (branches, commits, PRs)
- [ ] Verify RLHF scoring works for real code
- [ ] Document production readiness and enterprise viability
- [ ] Test integration between spec-kit and .regent systems
- [ ] Validate SpecToYamlTransformer functionality
- [ ] Ensure generated workflows execute successfully

**Production Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] Generated code compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (if generated)
- [ ] Linting rules are followed
- [ ] Git operations work correctly
- [ ] PR creation functions properly
- [ ] Code follows team conventions

## üöÄ Handoff to Fresh Dogfooder

When ready to start fresh dogfooding, provide this context-free starting prompt:

---

**FRESH DOGFOODING PROMPT:**

```
You are testing a CLI tool called 'regent' for the first time. You have no prior knowledge of this tool or its architecture patterns.

Your mission: Install and explore this CLI as a new developer would, documenting every step of your experience.

Start by:
1. Understanding what this tool does
2. Installing it globally
3. Exploring available commands
4. Trying to build something real with it

Document everything:
- What's confusing
- What works well
- Where you get stuck
- What you need help with

Be completely honest about the user experience. Don't assume anything or use expert knowledge.

Ready? Start with: "I'm exploring a new CLI tool called regent for the first time..."
```

## üîÑ Bug Mapper Instructions

As Bug Mapper, when fresh dogfooding begins:

1. **Monitor Progress**: Track dogfooding execution against this checklist
2. **Document Issues**: Use bug mapping template for any problems found
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for systemic issues vs one-off problems
4. **Update BUG-MAPPING-REPORT.md**: Add newly discovered issues
5. **Provide Support**: Answer questions without leading the dogfooder
6. **Maintain Objectivity**: Don't influence the fresh perspective

### Bug Prioritization
- **Critical**: Blocks basic functionality
- **High**: Significantly impacts user experience
- **Medium**: Causes confusion but has workarounds
- **Low**: Minor polish issues

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Current System Health (Pre-Fresh Dogfooding)
- ‚úÖ Core Architecture: Implemented
- ‚úÖ GitFlow Integration: Working
- ‚úÖ RLHF Scoring: Functional
- ‚úÖ spec-kit ‚Üî .regent Bridge: Operational
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Template Coverage: 60% (15/25 templates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation: Needs fresh-user validation

### Success Definition
Fresh dogfooding is successful when a new developer can:
1. Install the CLI without assistance
2. Create a working project using the tool
3. Implement a complete feature following Clean Architecture
4. Get meaningful feedback from the RLHF system
5. Successfully complete the GitFlow process
