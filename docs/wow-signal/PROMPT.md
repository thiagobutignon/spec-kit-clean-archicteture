# Claude Code: Deep Grammar Analysis of Clean Architecture

## Mission

Analyze the codebase as a **formal grammar system** rather than just code. Treat Clean Architecture (Rodrigo Manguinho's implementation) as a programming language with grammatical rules, similar to how natural languages
have syntax and semantics.

## Context: Linguistic Framework

Clean Architecture can be understood as a meta-language where:

- **Domain** = NOUN (entities, subjects)
- **Data** = VERB (actions, use cases)
- **Infrastructure** = ADVERB (how actions are performed)
- **Presentation** = CONTEXT (where/to whom)
- **Validation** = CLARITY (correctness rules)
- **Main** = INTENTION (sentence composition)

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Extract Grammatical Patterns

Identify recurring structural patterns that act as "grammar rules":

```
For each pattern found:
- What is the syntactic structure?
- What is the semantic meaning?
- How does it compose with other patterns?
- What constraints does it enforce?
```

**Examples to look for:**

```typescript
// Pattern: Use Case Contract
export namespace CreateBooking {
  export type Params = { ... }
  export type Result = { ... }
}

// Pattern: Function Object
class Calculator implements UseCase {
  constructor(private readonly deps) {}
  execute(params: Params): Result { ... }
}

// Pattern: Dependency Direction
Domain ← Data ← Infrastructure
```

### 2. Build the Grammar Ruleset

Create a formal grammar specification:

```
Grammar Rule Format:
- Rule ID: [DOM-001, DATA-001, etc]
- Pattern: [Regex or AST pattern]
- Linguistic Role: [Subject, Verb, Object, etc]
- Semantic Constraint: [What it means architecturally]
- Composition Rules: [How it combines with others]
```

**Example:**

```yaml
Rule: DOM-002
Pattern: export namespace \w+\s*\{[\s\S]*?export type (Params|Result)
Linguistic: "Verb definition requires direct object (Params) and predicate (Result)"
Semantic: "Every action must define what it operates on and what it produces"
Constraint: Use cases must have complete contracts
Violation: "Incomplete sentence - missing object or result"
```

### 3. Map to NLP Concepts

For each architectural layer, identify:

**Tokenization:**

- What are the atomic units? (classes, functions, types)
- How are they identified?

**Part-of-Speech Tagging:**

- How do you identify if something is Domain vs Data vs Infra?
- What markers distinguish each "POS"?

**Dependency Parsing:**

- What is the dependency tree structure?
- What relationships are allowed/forbidden?

**Semantic Analysis:**

- What does each pattern MEAN architecturally?
- Why do certain dependency directions matter?

### 4. Identify Deep vs Surface Structure

**Deep Structure (Universal):**

- Principles that work in ANY language (TS, Python, Swift, Go)
- Example: "Domain doesn't depend on Infrastructure"

**Surface Structure (Language-Specific):**

- How TypeScript expresses these principles
- Example: `export namespace` vs Python's `class Protocol`

### 5. Chomsky-Style Generative Grammar

Can you generate NEW valid code from the grammar rules?

```
Test: Given only grammar rules (no examples), generate:
1. A new use case (CreatePayment)
2. A new calculator (DiscountCalculator)
3. A new repository (PaymentRepository)

Do they follow all grammatical constraints automatically?
```

### 6. Validate Architectural Sentences

Analyze these "sentences" and determine if they're grammatically valid:

```typescript
// Sentence 1:
class User {
  constructor(private db: PostgresAdapter) {}
}
// Valid? Why/why not in grammatical terms?

// Sentence 2:
class UserRepository {
  constructor(private db: PostgresAdapter) {}
  save(user: User) { ... }
}
// Valid? Explain the grammatical structure.

// Sentence 3:
export namespace CreateBooking {
  export type Params = { date: Date }
}
// Complete sentence or fragment? What's missing?
```

### 7. Compare to Natural Language Grammars

Draw explicit parallels:

```
English Grammar:
- Subject + Verb + Object = "Dog eats food"
- Subject cannot depend on Adverb

Clean Arch Grammar:
- Domain + Data + Infra = "User creates via-Postgres"
- Domain cannot depend on Infrastructure

Map the complete parallel structure.
```

### 8. Anti-Patterns as Grammar Violations

Identify common violations and explain them linguistically:

```typescript
// Anti-pattern example
async function handleBooking(req, res) {
  const user = await db.users.find(...)
  const total = calculatePrice(...)
  res.json({ total })
}

Grammatical violation:
- "Run-on sentence" - multiple independent clauses not properly separated
- "Subject-verb agreement error" - mixing different grammatical roles
- Explain in linguistic terms why this violates grammar
```

### 9. Build Dependency Cruiser as Grammar Parser

Explain how Dependency Cruiser functions as:

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes modules/files
- **Parser**: Builds dependency tree (AST)
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Validates architectural meaning

Show the parse tree it would generate for this codebase.

### 10. Meta-Language Properties

Prove that Clean Architecture exhibits formal language properties:

```
1. Consistency: Same rules always apply
2. Composability: Patterns combine predictably
3. Expressiveness: Can express any business logic
4. Verifiability: Can validate grammatical correctness

Provide evidence from the codebase for each property.
```

## Deliverables

### 1. Formal Grammar Specification

Complete BNF-style grammar for Clean Architecture:

```bnf
<program> ::= <domain> <data> <infrastructure> <presentation> <main>
<domain> ::= <entities> <usecases>
<usecase> ::= "export namespace" <name> "{" <params> <result> "}"
...
```

### 2. Linguistic Analysis Document

```markdown
# Clean Architecture as Programming Grammar

## Part 1: Grammatical Structure

- Syntax rules
- Semantic rules
- Composition rules

## Part 2: Comparison to Natural Languages

- Parallels with English/Portuguese grammar
- Universal principles
- Language-specific expressions

## Part 3: NLP Pipeline for Architecture

- Tokenization
- POS Tagging
- Dependency Parsing
- Semantic Validation

## Part 4: Generative Capabilities

- Can we generate valid code from grammar alone?
- Test cases and results
```

### 3. Pattern Catalog

```yaml
patterns:
  - id: FunctionObject
    regex: "class \\w+ implements \\w+"
    linguistic_role: "Sentence structure - Subject performs action"
    examples: [...]
    violations: [...]

  - id: NamespaceContract
    regex: "export namespace \\w+\\s*\\{"
    linguistic_role: "Clause definition - action signature"
    examples: [...]
    violations: [...]
```

### 4. Validation Rules as Grammar Checker

Build a grammar checker that validates code like Grammarly validates English:

```typescript
interface GrammarChecker {
  check(code: string): GrammarError[];
}

interface GrammarError {
  rule: string;
  message: string;
  linguistic_explanation: string;
  suggestion: string;
}
```

## Special Focus Areas

### Manguinho's Specific Contributions

1. **Namespace pattern for use cases** - Why is this grammatically superior?
2. **Repository pattern** - What grammatical role does it play?
3. **Layer structure** - How does it enforce grammatical constraints?
4. **Dependency injection** - What is its linguistic function?

### Universal Grammar Discovery

Can you extract the "Universal Grammar" (à la Chomsky) of Clean Architecture that works across all programming languages?

```
Universal Rules:
1. Domain independence (works in TS, Python, Swift, Go)
2. Dependency inversion (language-agnostic)
3. Single responsibility (universal principle)

How are these expressed in each language's surface structure?
```

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded if you can:

1. ✅ Generate NEW valid code from grammar rules alone (no examples)
2. ✅ Detect violations and explain them in linguistic terms
3. ✅ Map Clean Architecture 1:1 to formal grammar notation
4. ✅ Show how Dependency Cruiser acts as architectural parser
5. ✅ Prove meta-language properties (consistency, composability, etc)
6. ✅ Extract patterns that work across multiple programming languages

## Output Format

Provide analysis in structured markdown with:

- Grammar rules in formal notation
- Code examples with linguistic annotations
- Violation examples with grammatical explanations
- Comparison tables (Natural Language ↔ Clean Architecture)
- Generative tests (can you create valid code from rules?)

## Think Like a Linguist

When analyzing, constantly ask:

- "What is the syntactic structure here?"
- "What does this mean semantically?"
- "How does this compose with other patterns?"
- "What universal principle does this express?"
- "How would this be expressed in another language?"

Remember: You're not just analyzing code quality - you're discovering the **formal grammar of software architecture**.
