# Dogfooding Artifacts: execute-steps.ts Refactoring

This directory contains the complete artifacts from The Regent's successful dogfooding experiment - refactoring its own 2000-line monolith (`execute-steps.ts`) into Clean Architecture.

## 📁 Files

### `implement-executor.regent`

**50-step complete refactoring plan** (Second Run)

- **Size**: ~55KB, 1,674 lines
- **Scope**: Complete Clean Architecture implementation
- **Layers**: 6 (domain, data, infrastructure, presentation, validation, main)
- **Files Generated**: 50+ files
- **Quality Checks**: Lint, tests, TypeScript compilation after each step
- **RLHF Score**: 2/2 (perfect execution)

This is the **production-grade** plan that successfully transformed the monolith into a maintainable, testable architecture.

**Key Features:**

- Domain layer with entities, use cases, repositories
- Data layer with concrete implementations
- Infrastructure layer with file system operations
- Presentation layer with controllers and DTOs
- Validation layer with schema validators
- Main layer with composition root and dependency injection

### `implement.regent`

**30-step initial refactoring plan** (First Run)

- **Size**: ~27KB, 850 lines
- **Scope**: Initial extraction attempt
- **RLHF Score**: 0/2 (failed - missing validation layer)

This was the **learning run** that revealed gaps in the approach:

- Missing validation layer
- Incomplete error handling
- Lacked comprehensive testing strategy

The failures here informed the improvements in `implement-executor.regent`.

### `prompt.md`

**Planning documentation and context**

- **Size**: ~22KB, 627 lines
- **Purpose**: Initial planning, requirements gathering, architecture decisions

Contains:

- Reference codebase analysis (clean-ts-api by Rodrigo Manguinho)
- Pattern extraction results
- Layer-by-layer planning
- Quality criteria definition
- Success metrics

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric                  | Value                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Total Steps**         | 50 automated steps               |
| **Commits**             | 18 with automated quality checks |
| **Files Created**       | 50+ across 6 layers              |
| **RLHF Score**          | 2/2 (perfect execution)          |
| **Manual Intervention** | Zero (after initial corrections) |
| **Execution Time**      | ~2 hours (automated)             |
| **Lines Refactored**    | 2000+ → 50+ files                |

## 🔍 What Makes This Special

### Deterministic Execution

Every step was executed by **systems**, not manually:

1. Pattern extracted from reference codebase (Serena MCP)
2. Plan generated by AI (Claude)
3. Steps executed deterministically (The Regent)
4. Quality validated automatically (lint, tests, tsc)
5. Feedback scored automatically (RLHF)

### Reproducibility

You can reproduce this exact refactoring:

```bash
the-regent-cli execute implement-executor.regent
```

Every step will produce identical results because:

- File operations are deterministic
- Patterns are extracted from verified references
- Quality checks are automated
- Git commits preserve each step

### Self-Improvement

The system learned from failures:

- First run (implement.regent) → identified gaps
- RLHF scored 0/2 → triggered analysis
- Second run (implement-executor.regent) → incorporated learnings
- RLHF scored 2/2 → validated improvements

## 🎓 Case Study Highlights

### The Namespace Pollution Bug

During execution, a critical bug was discovered and fixed systematically:

- **Problem**: `zx/globals` polluting namespace with `$`, `cd`, `fetch`
- **Discovery**: Automated via pattern analysis, not trial-and-error
- **Fix**: Systematic refactoring across all affected files
- **Validation**: All tests passed, RLHF scored 2/2

This bug fix is documented in detail in the main methodology document.

### Architectural Transformation

**Before:**

```
execute-steps.ts (2000+ lines)
├── Step parsing mixed with execution
├── File operations scattered throughout
├── No clear boundaries
├── Hard to test
└── Violates every SOLID principle
```

**After:**

```
src/
├── domain/         (business logic, entities, use cases)
├── data/          (repository implementations)
├── infra/         (file system, external services)
├── presentation/  (controllers, DTOs, mappers)
├── validation/    (schema validation, error handling)
└── main/          (composition root, dependency injection)
```
