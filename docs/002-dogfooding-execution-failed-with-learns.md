# REGENT CLI Dogfooding Execution - Failed with Critical Learnings

## üéØ Mission
Execute fresh REGENT CLI dogfooding with zero prior assumptions. Test real user onboarding experience and validate that the CLI provides seamless developer experience for Clean Architecture implementation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DOGFOODING STATUS: FAILED
**Reason**: Critical architectural mismatch between command system and template system
**Blocking Issue**: #93 - Commands do not use .regent templates
**Date**: 2024-09-28
**Version Tested**: regent-cli@2.0.1

## üë• Role Assignments
- **Fresh Dogfooder**: New Claude executor (zero context, fresh perspective)
- **Bug Mapper**: Current Claude (maps issues found during dogfooding, maintains BUG-MAPPING-REPORT.md)
- **Reviewer**: Continues PR reviews and maintains code quality

## üîß Environment Setup
### Pre-requisites
- [x] Uninstall existing `regent` globally: `npm uninstall -g regent`
- [x] Uninstall existing `spec-ca` globally: `npm uninstall -g spec-ca`
- [x] Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- [x] Install fresh REGENT: `npm install -g .` (from project root)

## üìã Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Initial CLI Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
- [x] Verify `regent --help` works
- [x] Test `regent --version`
- [x] List all available commands
- [x] Document first impressions and setup friction
- [x] Validate CLI can be found in PATH

**Expected Commands:**
- `/01-plan-layer-features`
- `/02-validate-layer-plan`
- `/03-generate-layer-code`
- `/06-execute-layer-steps`
- `/implement` (orchestrator)

### Phase 2: Project Initialization üöÄ
- [x] Run `regent init` on completely fresh project
- [x] Follow all prompts naturally (no shortcuts or expert knowledge)
- [x] Document user experience gaps and unclear messaging
- [x] Test generated project structure matches expectations
- [x] Verify .regent templates are properly initialized
- [x] Validate Clean Architecture folder structure creation
- [x] Test that all necessary dependencies are installed

**Critical Validation Points:**
- [x] .regent/templates/ directory created with all required templates (15 templates found)
- [x] .claude/commands/ directory populated with slash commands (all commands present)
- [x] package.json contains all necessary dependencies
- [x] TypeScript configuration properly set up
- [x] Clean Architecture layers properly scaffolded

**Observations:**
‚úÖ Project successfully created in `packages/dogfooding`
‚úÖ All templates installed (backend, frontend, fullstack)
‚úÖ Claude commands properly configured
‚úÖ Git repository initialized
‚ö†Ô∏è Created inside packages/ directory (not standalone)
üìù Next steps guidance provided clearly

### Phase 3: Clean Architecture Workflow üîÑ
- [x] Use `/01-plan-layer-features` for a real feature (suggest: user authentication)
- [ ] ‚ùå BLOCKED: Execute `/02-validate-layer-plan` - Cannot proceed due to Issue #93
- [ ] ‚ùå BLOCKED: Run `/03-generate-layer-code` - Cannot proceed due to Issue #93
- [ ] ‚ùå BLOCKED: Complete `/06-execute-layer-steps` - Cannot proceed due to Issue #93
- [x] Document workflow friction points and unclear guidance
- [ ] Test error handling when steps fail
- [ ] Verify RLHF scoring provides meaningful feedback

**Workflow Validation:**
- ‚ùå Plan ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Execute sequence BROKEN (Critical architectural mismatch)
- [x] Each step provides clear feedback to user
- [ ] Error messages are actionable and helpful
- ‚ùå Generated code DOES NOT follow Clean Architecture templates
- [ ] RLHF scores accurately reflect code quality (-2 to +2 scale)

**Phase 3.1: /01-plan-layer-features Results**
‚ö†Ô∏è Command executed but with CRITICAL ISSUES:
‚ùå **DOES NOT** read .regent templates
‚ùå **DOES NOT** follow Vertical Slice Architecture
‚ùå Generated incompatible structure at `spec/001-user-authentication/domain/plan.json`
‚ùå Plan structure mismatches template expectations:
  - Uses `entities` instead of `models`
  - Creates `value-objects` at wrong level
  - Missing use-case slices pattern
  - Wrong folder hierarchy (horizontal vs vertical slicing)
‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed format: both "steps" and "tasks" arrays (Issue #92)

## üî¥ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Issue #93: Command-Template Complete Disconnection
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks entire workflow
**Root Cause**: `/01-plan-layer-features` command never reads or uses .regent templates
**Impact**:
- Generated structure incompatible with templates
- Subsequent commands will fail
- Workflow integration completely broken

**Evidence**:
```
Generated: src/features/user-authentication/domain/entities/user.ts
Expected:  src/features/user/create-user/domain/usecases/create-user.ts
```

### Architectural Mismatch
- **Command uses**: Horizontal layering (domain/data/infra grouped)
- **Templates use**: Vertical slicing (use-case based organization)
- **Result**: Complete structural incompatibility

### Phase 4: Real Development Test üèóÔ∏è
- [ ] Implement actual feature using REGENT (not just examples)
- [ ] Follow Clean Architecture layer constraints strictly
- [ ] Test GitFlow enforcement (branches, commits, PRs)
- [ ] Verify RLHF scoring works for real code
- [ ] Document production readiness and enterprise viability
- [ ] Test integration between spec-kit and .regent systems
- [ ] Validate SpecToYamlTransformer functionality
- [ ] Ensure generated workflows execute successfully

**Production Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] Generated code compiles without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (if generated)
- [ ] Linting rules are followed
- [ ] Git operations work correctly
- [ ] PR creation functions properly
- [ ] Code follows team conventions

## üöÄ Handoff to Fresh Dogfooder

When ready to start fresh dogfooding, provide this context-free starting prompt:

---

**FRESH DOGFOODING PROMPT:**

```
You are testing a CLI tool called 'regent' for the first time. You have no prior knowledge of this tool or its architecture patterns.

Your mission: Install and explore this CLI as a new developer would, documenting every step of your experience.

Start by:
1. Understanding what this tool does
2. Installing it globally
3. Exploring available commands
4. Trying to build something real with it

Document everything:
- What's confusing
- What works well
- Where you get stuck
- What you need help with

Be completely honest about the user experience. Don't assume anything or use expert knowledge.

Ready? Start with: "I'm exploring a new CLI tool called regent for the first time..."
```

## üîÑ Bug Mapper Instructions

As Bug Mapper, when fresh dogfooding begins:

1. **Monitor Progress**: Track dogfooding execution against this checklist
2. **Document Issues**: Use bug mapping template for any problems found
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for systemic issues vs one-off problems
4. **Update BUG-MAPPING-REPORT.md**: Add newly discovered issues
5. **Provide Support**: Answer questions without leading the dogfooder
6. **Maintain Objectivity**: Don't influence the fresh perspective

### Bug Prioritization
- **Critical**: Blocks basic functionality
- **High**: Significantly impacts user experience
- **Medium**: Causes confusion but has workarounds
- **Low**: Minor polish issues

## üìà Progress Tracking

### System Health (Post-Dogfooding Failure)
- ‚úÖ Core Architecture: Implemented (but disconnected)
- ‚úÖ GitFlow Integration: Working
- ‚úÖ RLHF Scoring: Functional
- ‚ùå spec-kit ‚Üî .regent Bridge: **BROKEN** (commands don't use templates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Template Coverage: 60% (15/25 templates)
- ‚ùå Documentation: Describes non-existent integration

### Failure Analysis
Dogfooding failed at Phase 3 because:
1. ‚úÖ CLI installs correctly
2. ‚úÖ Project initialization works
3. ‚ùå Feature implementation FAILS due to architectural mismatch
4. ‚ùå Commands generate incompatible structures
5. ‚ùå Templates are never consulted

## üìö LESSONS LEARNED FROM FAILURE

### 1. **System Integration Gap**
The most critical discovery: The command system (`.claude/commands/`) and template system (`.regent/templates/`) operate independently without integration.

### 2. **Architectural Pattern Mismatch**
- **Commands assume**: Traditional horizontal layering
- **Templates implement**: Modern vertical slicing
- **Result**: Complete incompatibility

### 3. **Missing Validation Layer**
No validation exists to ensure commands generate template-compatible structures.

### 4. **Documentation vs Reality**
Documentation describes an integrated system, but implementation shows disconnected subsystems.

### 5. **Testing Gap**
End-to-end workflow testing would have caught this integration failure early.

## üîß REQUIRED FIXES

### Priority 1: Critical (Blocks Everything)
- **Issue #93**: Commands must read and use .regent templates
- **Issue #92**: Standardize JSON plan format

### Priority 2: High (Major UX Issues)
- **Issue #90**: Update check command references
- **Issue #88**: Fix version flag convention
- **Issue #87**: Update banner references

### Priority 3: Medium (Feature Gaps)
- **Issue #91**: Add MCP tools detection
- **Issue #70**: Complete missing templates

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. **STOP** further dogfooding until Issue #93 is resolved
2. **FIX** the command-template integration
3. **ADD** validation between commands and templates
4. **TEST** end-to-end workflow before next dogfooding

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Unify** command and template systems
2. **Create** integration tests for full workflow
3. **Document** actual implementation (not ideal)
4. **Add** template validation to commands
