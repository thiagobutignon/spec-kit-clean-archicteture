# Dogfooding Strategy - Phase 6 Continuation

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phases 1-5: Complete (6,336 lines of documentation generated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 6: Started but discovered critical issues
- üíæ Implementation saved in stash: `dogfooding-phase6-implement-output`

## Discovered Issues
1. **Two Parallel Systems**: spec-kit vs .regent not integrated
2. **No YAML Workflow**: `/implement` bypasses execute-steps.ts
3. **No GitFlow**: Direct file creation without branches/PRs
4. **Wasted Planning**: 6,336 lines not leveraged for execution

## How to Continue

### Option A: Fix and Retry (Recommended)
1. Wait for issues #75-#78 to be addressed
2. Use the corrected workflow:
   ```bash
   /01-plan-layer-features from task: T001
   /02-validate-layer-plan [json-output]
   /03-generate-layer-code [validated-json]
   /06-execute-layer-steps [yaml-file]
   ```

### Option B: Manual YAML Creation
1. Recover stash: `git stash pop`
2. Create YAML manually based on implemented code
3. Use as template for future tasks
4. Example YAML structure:
   ```yaml
   domain_steps:
     - id: create-feature-branch
       type: branch
       action:
         branch_name: feature/T001-project-entity

     - id: create-project-entity
       type: create_file
       path: src/features/project-init/domain/entities/Project.ts
       template: |
         [actual code from stash]

     - id: create-tests
       type: create_file
       path: src/features/project-init/domain/entities/Project.test.ts
       template: |
         [test code from stash]

     - id: run-tests
       type: validation
       validation_script: |
         npm test src/features/project-init/domain/entities/Project.test.ts

     - id: create-pr
       type: pull_request
       action:
         source_branch: feature/T001-project-entity
         target_branch: main
         title: "feat(domain): implement Project entity (T001)"
   ```

### Option C: Document and Pivot
1. Use discovered issues to improve the system
2. Create integration layer between spec-kit and .regent
3. Build transformer: Tasks ‚Üí YAML
4. Continue with next phase after fixes

## Recovery Commands

### To View Saved Work:
```bash
git stash list                    # See all stashes
git stash show -p stash@{0}       # View changes in detail
```

### To Recover Work:
```bash
git stash pop                      # Apply and remove stash
# OR
git stash apply                    # Apply but keep stash
```

### To See What Was Created:
```bash
git stash show stash@{0} --name-only  # List files
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Dogfooding Works!** - We found real architectural issues
2. **Documentation != Implementation** - Planning and execution are disconnected
3. **YAML is Missing Link** - Need to bridge spec-kit and .regent
4. **GitFlow is Critical** - Deterministic builds require proper branching

## Success Metrics

Despite issues, we achieved:
- ‚úÖ 6,336 lines of documentation generated
- ‚úÖ 46 tasks properly planned
- ‚úÖ 4 critical issues discovered
- ‚úÖ Working implementation (in stash)
- ‚úÖ 22 passing tests

## Recommendation

**Don't throw away the work!** The stashed files are valuable:
1. They prove the domain logic is correct
2. Tests are comprehensive and passing
3. Can be used as reference for YAML generation
4. Show what the final output should look like

## Next Session

When continuing:
1. Check if issues #75-#78 are addressed
2. Decide which option (A, B, or C) to follow
3. Use stashed work as reference/validation
4. Document any new discoveries
