# üêï Dogfooding The Regent CLI

## Purpose

This document tracks the dogfooding process of using The Regent to build its own CLI with React + Ink.

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Create packages/cli directory structure
- [x] Initialize package.json with Ink dependencies
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create initial documentation

### Phase 2: Regent Initialization ‚úÖ
- [x] Run `regent init --here --ai claude --no-git` (Fixed tsconfig.json paths issue)
- [x] Regent successfully initialized with .regent/ directory
- [x] Execute `/constitution` to establish principles
  - Created comprehensive CONSTITUTION.md (217 lines)
  - Established Clean Architecture + React/Ink principles
  - Defined feature-sliced architecture for commands
- [x] Create specifications with `/specify`
  - Generated SPEC-001-init-command (2,433 lines total!)
  - 5 comprehensive documents created

### Phase 3: Feature Specification ‚úÖ
- [x] Generate `init` command specification
  - spec.md (529 lines)
  - domain-model.md (471 lines)
  - api-contract.md (471 lines)
  - test-scenarios.md (518 lines)
  - acceptance-criteria.md (449 lines)
- [ ] Generate `check` command specification
- [ ] Generate `generate` command specification

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning ‚úÖ
- [x] Execute `/plan from spec: SPEC-001-init-command`
  - Generated PLAN-SPEC-001-cli (3,016 lines total!)
  - plan.md (689 lines)
  - architecture-diagram.md (360 lines)
  - api-specs.md (659 lines)
  - database-schema.md (572 lines)
  - test-plan.md (741 lines)

### Phase 5: Task Generation ‚úÖ
- [x] Execute `/tasks from plan: PLAN-SPEC-001-cli`
  - Generated TASK-LIST-SPEC-001-cli.md (670 lines)
  - 46 implementation tasks organized in 6 phases
  - 65 Story Points total (Note: increased from 40 SP in plan)
  - 10-12 working days estimated

### Phase 6: Layer Implementation (In Progress - Issue Found)
Expected workflow NOT followed by `/implement`:
- [‚ùå] `/implement from task: T001` - Executed but didn't trigger YAML flow
- [ ] `/01-plan-layer-features` - Should generate JSON plan (not triggered)
- [ ] `/02-validate-layer-plan` - Should validate JSON (not triggered)
- [ ] `/03-generate-layer-code` - Should create YAML (not triggered)
- [ ] `/06-execute-layer-steps` - Should execute YAML (not triggered)

**WORKAROUND NEEDED**: Must manually execute layer commands instead of relying on /implement

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Validate Path Resolution**: Confirm `./spec/` paths work correctly
2. **Test Template Substitution**: Verify `__PLACEHOLDER__` patterns
3. **Clean Architecture Compliance**: Ensure proper layer separation
4. **RLHF Scoring**: Achieve consistent +1 or +2 scores

## Discovered Issues & Insights

### Critical Issues - Phase 6 Implementation:

#### ‚ùå YAML Workflow Not Used
- `/implement from task: T001` didn't use YAML workflow
  - Expected: Generate JSON plan ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Create YAML ‚Üí Execute steps
  - Actual: Direct implementation without YAML generation
  - Missing: `/01-plan-layer-features`, `/02-validate`, `/03-generate`, `/06-execute`
  - Impact: No structured workflow, no validation, no RLHF scoring opportunity

#### ‚ùå GitFlow Violation
- `/implement` created files directly without branches or PRs
  - Expected: Create feature branch ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Create PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
  - Actual: Direct file creation on current branch
  - Missing GitFlow steps from execute-steps.ts (lines 616-641):
    - `type: branch` with `branch_name`
    - `type: pull_request` with source/target branches
  - Impact: No deterministic build process, no review gates, no CI/CD triggers

### Fixed in PR #73:
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded paths causing files in wrong location
- ‚úÖ Inconsistent placeholder patterns
- ‚úÖ Mermaid diagram syntax errors

### Fixed During Dogfooding Setup:
- ‚úÖ `tsconfig.json` path mappings with multiple wildcards not allowed
  - Fixed by simplifying path patterns to single wildcards
- ‚úÖ `package.json` postinstall script looking for wrong binary
  - Fixed by updating from `bin/spec-ca` to `bin/regent`

### Discovered During Phase 2:
- ‚úÖ `/constitution` command works perfectly from Claude Code
  - Generated comprehensive 217-line CONSTITUTION.md
  - Clean Architecture principles properly established
  - Feature-sliced architecture well-defined for CLI commands
- ‚úÖ `.regent/` directory structure created successfully
  - Templates installed correctly
  - Core files in place
  - Scripts available via npm commands

### Discovered During Phase 3:
- ‚úÖ `/specify` command generates extremely comprehensive specifications
  - Created 2,433 lines across 5 documents (impressive!)
  - Properly structured in `.specify/specs/SPEC-001-init-command/`
  - Includes all necessary artifacts: spec, domain-model, api-contract, test-scenarios, acceptance-criteria
- ‚úÖ Specification quality is exceptional
  - 52 test scenarios defined
  - 20 detailed acceptance criteria
  - 5 project templates specified (API, CLI, Fullstack, Library, Microservice)
  - React + Ink UI components properly defined
- ‚úÖ Domain modeling for CLI is well-structured
  - Aggregate roots: Project, Template, Configuration
  - Value objects with validation rules
  - Repository interfaces defined
  - Domain events specified

### Discovered During Phase 4:
- ‚úÖ `/plan` command generates even more comprehensive implementation plans
  - Created 3,016 lines across 5 documents (exceeding specification!)
  - Complete architecture diagrams with Mermaid
  - Detailed API specifications with interface contracts
  - Database schema for configuration and history
  - Comprehensive test plan with ~500 test cases
- ‚úÖ Planning quality demonstrates exceptional detail
  - 10-day implementation timeline with 5 phases
  - 40 story points estimated
  - 90% overall test coverage target (100% for domain)
  - Layer-specific implementation details
- ‚úÖ Clean Architecture mapping is precise
  - Proper separation of React + Ink in presentation layer
  - Domain layer completely framework-agnostic
  - Infrastructure adapters for file system, Git, npm
  - Feature-sliced architecture maintained

### Discovered During Phase 5:
- ‚úÖ `/tasks` command generates granular implementation tasks
  - Created 670 lines of detailed tasks
  - 46 individual tasks with clear acceptance criteria
  - Tasks organized by Clean Architecture layers
  - Priority levels assigned (Primary, Secondary, Integration)
- ‚úÖ Task estimation reveals complexity
  - Story points increased from 40 (plan) to 65 (tasks) - 62.5% increase
  - More granular breakdown revealed hidden complexity
  - 10-12 working days estimated duration
  - Explicit dependencies enable parallel work
- ‚úÖ Task organization follows Clean Architecture
  - Phase 1: Domain Layer (16 tasks, 15.5 SP)
  - Phase 2: Data Layer (5 tasks, 10 SP)
  - Phase 3: Infrastructure (6 tasks, 11 SP)
  - Phase 4: Presentation/React+Ink (10 tasks, 14.5 SP)
  - Phase 5: Main/Composition (4 tasks, 5 SP)
  - Phase 6: Integration & Testing (5 tasks, 9 SP)

### Observations:
- The Regent successfully initializes within a subdirectory (`packages/cli`)
- Path resolution works correctly after fixes
- Claude Code integration seamless with slash commands
- Constitution generation captures all necessary architectural decisions

### To Be Discovered:
- How `/specify` handles React + Ink component specifications
- Template generation for presentation layer with React components
- RLHF scoring for interactive UI code
- Layer generation workflow for CLI-specific features

## Architecture Decisions

### Why React + Ink?
- Modern terminal UI capabilities
- Component-based architecture aligns with Clean Architecture
- Rich ecosystem of Ink components
- TypeScript support for type safety

### Feature Slicing Strategy
Each CLI command is a feature slice:
```
features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init/          # regent init command
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ check/         # regent check command
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generate/      # template generation
```

### Clean Architecture Layers
- **Domain**: Command interfaces and business logic
- **Data**: Command implementations
- **Infrastructure**: File system, git operations
- **Presentation**: Ink components for UI
- **Main**: CLI composition and dependency injection

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Action: `/tasks`

Now that PLAN-SPEC-001-cli is complete, generate actionable tasks:

```
/tasks from plan: PLAN-SPEC-001-cli
```

This will break down the plan into specific, actionable tasks organized by layer and priority.

### Alternative: Continue Specifications

To complete all specifications before planning:

1. **For `check` command:**
```
/specify "CLI command to validate system requirements, check Clean Architecture compliance, and verify RLHF scores using React + Ink for visual feedback"
```

2. **For `generate` command:**
```
/specify "Interactive template generation command with layer selection, feature slicing support, and real-time preview using React + Ink components"
```

## Critical Architectural Analysis

### Two Parallel Systems Discovery

After Phase 6 implementation attempt, a critical architectural disconnect was discovered:

#### System 1: spec-kit Commands
- **Commands**: `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`
- **Output**: Markdown documentation (6,336+ lines generated)
- **Execution**: Direct code generation without validation
- **Location**: Part of the main CLI system

#### System 2: .regent Template Engine
- **Commands**: `/01-plan-layer-features`, `/02-validate`, `/03-generate`, `/06-execute`
- **Output**: YAML workflows with validation steps
- **Execution**: execute-steps.ts (808 lines of robust validation)
- **Location**: `.regent/config/` directory

#### The Disconnect
These systems operate independently when they should be integrated:
1. spec-kit does extensive planning (6,336 lines of docs)
2. But doesn't generate YAML for .regent execution
3. `/implement` bypasses the YAML workflow entirely
4. execute-steps.ts with its validation is never invoked

#### Performance Implication
As correctly observed: "a execu√ß√£o seria muito muito mais r√°pida" because:
- spec-kit has already analyzed everything
- Converting to YAML would be a simple transformation
- No need to re-analyze for YAML generation
- The work is 90% complete after `/tasks`

### GitHub Issues Created
1. **#75**: Critical architectural disconnect between systems
2. **#76**: `/implement` bypasses layer workflow
3. **#77**: Optimization opportunity for YAML generation
4. **#78**: GitFlow violation - no branches or PRs created

### Expected YAML Structure for GitFlow

For T001, the YAML should have included:

```yaml
domain_steps:
  - id: create-feature-branch
    type: branch
    action:
      branch_name: feature/T001-project-entity
    validation_script: |
      git checkout -b feature/T001-project-entity

  - id: create-files
    type: create_file
    # ... file creation steps

  - id: run-tests
    type: validation
    validation_script: |
      npm test

  - id: create-pull-request
    type: pull_request
    action:
      source_branch: feature/T001-project-entity
      target_branch: main
      title: 'feat(domain): implement Project entity (T001)'
```

### Architectural Recommendation

Integrate the systems by:
1. Make spec-kit commands generate YAML as output
2. Route all execution through execute-steps.ts
3. Transform existing markdown outputs to YAML steps
4. Maintain single source of truth
5. **Enforce GitFlow with branch and PR steps**

This would provide:
- **10x faster execution** - No re-analysis needed
- **Quality assurance** - Layer validation and RLHF scoring
- **Audit trail** - YAML tracks all execution steps
- **Rollback capability** - Step status tracking
- **Deterministic builds** - GitFlow ensures repeatability

## Notes

This is a live dogfooding exercise. All findings will improve The Regent system.
