            const comment = `## ‚ùå Command Consistency Validation Failed

            The command consistency validator detected issues with the slash commands in this PR.

            ### What to do next:

            1. **Review the validation errors** in the [workflow logs](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            2. **Fix the identified inconsistencies** in the affected command files
            3. **Re-run validation locally** to verify fixes:
               \`\`\`bash
               npm run validate:commands
               \`\`\`
            4. **Push your fixes** - this check will run automatically

            ### Common Issues:

            - **Terminology drift**: Commands using different terms for same concepts
            - **Missing YAML keywords**: Commands not referencing YAML structure
            - **Execution order**: Missing references to proper command sequence
            - **Rule references**: Commands not citing architectural rules
            - **Template patterns**: Commands not following established patterns
