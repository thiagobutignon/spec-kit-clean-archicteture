## üìã Overview

Spec-Kit Clean Architecture is an evolution of [GitHub's Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), enhanced with intelligent RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) scoring system for deterministic software development. This framework ensures your code follows Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD, and SOLID principles through automated validation and continuous improvement.

## üéØ The Core Problem: Beyond the Black Box

Current AI coding assistants operate as a "black box": a prompt goes in, a large volume of code comes out. This process lacks the predictability, auditability, and quality control required for professional software engineering. Key failures include:

- **Lack of Predictability:** The same prompt can yield different results, making automation unreliable.
- **No Atomic Changes:** Large, monolithic code dumps make reviews difficult and rollbacks impossible.
- **Absence of Quality Gates:** Code is generated without guarantees that it adheres to architectural principles or coding standards.
- **Ignoring Existing Context:** Solutions often fail in brownfield projects because they don't deeply understand the existing codebase.

**Spec-Kit Clean Architecture was built to solve this.** We replace the black box with a transparent, step-by-step, and fully validated engineering workflow.

## üîÑ The ReAct Lifecycle: From Concept to Commit

Our system models the workflow of a senior engineering team using the Reason-Act (ReAct) framework. Each feature is built through a series of auditable, single-responsibility commands:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: User Concept] --> B{/pre-tasks-domain}
    B -- "Generates Plan" --> C{/validate-domain-json}
    C -- "Validates Plan" --> D{/tasks-domain}
    D -- "Generates YAML" --> E{/reflection-tasks-domain}
    E -- "Refines YAML" --> F{/evaluate-tasks-domain}
    F -- "Approves YAML" --> G[User Review & Approval]
    G -- "Triggers Execution" --> H{/execute-domain}
    H -- "Executes Step by Step" --> I[Success: Commits in Git]
    H -- "On Failure" --> J{/fix-failed-step}
    J -- "Generates Fix Plan" --> D

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style I fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style G fill:#ff9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Three Critical Phases:

1. **Reasoning Loop (Phases A-F):** The AI researches, plans, validates, and refines a detailed implementation plan (the YAML). This entire loop operates on configuration data, not code.

2. **User Approval (Phase G):** A human engineer reviews the final, approved plan. This is the critical "go/no-go" decision point.

3. **Action Loop (Phases H-J):** Only after approval does the system act on the codebase, executing the plan step-by-step, with a built-in loop for fixing failures.

## üíæ Stateless and Resumable by Design

Unlike chat-based workflows that lose context, our system is fundamentally stateless. The `implementation.yaml` file **is the state**.

### Key Benefits:

- **Resumable Execution:** If the `execute-steps.ts` script fails or is interrupted on step 7, the YAML file is saved with step 7 marked as `FAILED`. You can simply re-run the script, and it will automatically skip the first 6 successful steps and retry from step 7.

- **No Context Overload:** The AI doesn't need to hold the entire project history in its context window. Each command (`/pre-tasks`, `/evaluate`, etc.) is a discrete task that operates on a well-defined input (JSON or YAML), making the process scalable and predictable.

- **Audit Trail:** Every step, success, or failure is recorded in the YAML with timestamps, RLHF scores, and execution logs. This creates a complete audit trail of the development process.

- **Parallel Development:** Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously, each with their own YAML state file, without interference.

## üìñ Architecture Principles

This framework enforces best practices through automated validation:

- **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns with pure domain layer
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** - Ubiquitous language and bounded contexts
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - Test helpers for every use case
- **SOLID Principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Simplicity over complexity
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - No premature optimization
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Code reusability

## ü§ñ RLHF Scoring System

The intelligent scoring system evaluates code quality in real-time:

| Score  | Level             | Description                                    |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **+2** | üèÜ PERFECT        | Clean Architecture + DDD + Ubiquitous Language |
| **+1** | ‚úÖ GOOD           | Valid implementation following patterns        |
| **0**  | ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW CONFIDENCE | Missing references or documentation            |
| **-1** | ‚ùå RUNTIME ERROR  | Lint failures, test failures                   |
| **-2** | üí• CATASTROPHIC   | Architecture violations                        |

## üîç Deep Search Integration with HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model)

### Understanding HRM in Software Engineering

The [Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)](https://github.com/sapientinc/HRM) from Sapient Inc. introduces a revolutionary approach to code analysis through hierarchical reasoning. Unlike traditional RLHF which focuses on model training, our implementation leverages HRM concepts for:

#### üß† Hierarchical Code Analysis

```
High-Level Planning ‚Üí Domain Understanding ‚Üí Use Case Mapping
         ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Low-Level Execution ‚Üí Code Generation ‚Üí Pattern Recognition
```

- **Level 1 (Strategic)**: Architectural patterns and domain boundaries
- **Level 2 (Tactical)**: Use cases, entities, and value objects
- **Level 3 (Implementation)**: Specific code patterns and syntax

#### üéØ HRM Application in Clean Architecture

1. **Pattern Recognition Hierarchy**

   - **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic patterns (RLHF +2)
   - **Application Layer**: Use case orchestration patterns (RLHF +1)
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: Integration patterns (RLHF 0)

2. **Recursive Reasoning**

   - Analyze code at multiple abstraction levels simultaneously
   - Detect architectural violations through hierarchical pattern matching
   - Self-correct based on learned patterns from successful implementations

3. **Adaptive Learning Cycles**

   ```typescript
   // HRM-inspired learning cycle
   for (let cycle = 0; cycle < MAX_CYCLES; cycle++) {
     const analysis = analyzeCodeHierarchy(implementation);
     const score = calculateRLHFScore(analysis);

     if (score >= TARGET_SCORE) break;

     const improvements = generateImprovements(analysis);
     implementation = applyImprovements(implementation, improvements);
   }
   ```

### Serena Integration

The framework integrates with Serena for semantic code search:

- **Hierarchical Symbol Analysis**: Navigate code at different abstraction levels
- **Pattern Matching**: Find similar patterns across the codebase
- **Context-Aware Refactoring**: Understand impact across architectural layers
- **Memory System**: Retain project knowledge for future reasoning

### Context7 Integration

External library documentation through Context7:

- **Real-time Library Analysis**: Understand external dependencies
- **Pattern Extraction**: Learn from library best practices
- **API Mapping**: Connect domain concepts to library implementations
- **Cross-Reference Learning**: Apply patterns from successful libraries

### üî¨ Deep Learning Without Training

Our HRM implementation differs from traditional ML approaches:

| Traditional RLHF        | Our HRM Implementation    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Model training required | No training needed        |
| Large datasets needed   | Works with single project |
| GPU intensive           | Runs on CPU               |
| Static after training   | Continuously adapts       |
| General purpose         | Domain-specific           |

#### Key Innovations:

1. **Hierarchical Pattern Database**

   ```yaml
   patterns:
     architectural:
       - clean_architecture: weight: 1.0
       - ddd_boundaries: weight: 0.9
     tactical:
       - use_case_interface: weight: 0.8
       - value_object_pattern: weight: 0.7
     implementation:
       - typescript_types: weight: 0.6
       - test_coverage: weight: 0.5
   ```

2. **Multi-Level Scoring**

   - Each hierarchical level contributes to final RLHF score
   - Weighted average based on architectural importance
   - Self-balancing based on project characteristics

3. **Reasoning Chains**
   - Traces decision paths through code
   - Explains why certain patterns are preferred
   - Provides actionable improvement suggestions

## üìä Performance

- **Pattern Caching**: 5-minute cache with LRU eviction
- **Progress Reporting**: Visual progress bars with persistence
- **Memory Management**: Bounded cache size (100 entries max)
- **Resumable Operations**: Progress saved for recovery

## ‚ùì Why Not Just Use Chat-Based AI?

### The Fundamental Difference:

| Chat-Based AI (GPT, Claude, etc.)                              | Spec-Kit Clean Architecture                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Monolithic Output**: Generates entire files/features at once | **Atomic Steps**: Each change is a single, reviewable commit |
| **Context Decay**: Loses context over long conversations       | **Stateless**: YAML file maintains complete state            |
| **No Quality Gates**: Output quality varies                    | **RLHF Scoring**: Every step validated (-2 to +2)            |
| **Manual Rollback**: Developer must undo changes manually      | **Automatic Rollback**: Failed steps can be rolled back      |
| **Opaque Process**: "Black box" generation                     | **Transparent Pipeline**: Every decision is auditable        |
| **Generic Solutions**: Not aware of your architecture          | **Architecture-Aware**: Enforces your specific patterns      |

### Real-World Example:

**Chat-Based Approach:**

```
You: "Create a user registration feature"
AI: [Generates 500+ lines across 10 files]
Result: All-or-nothing - if one part is wrong, manual fixes needed
```

**Spec-Kit Approach:**

```yaml
steps:
  - id: create-branch # ‚úÖ Step 1: Git branch created
  - id: create-use-case # ‚úÖ Step 2: Use case interface created
  - id: create-errors # ‚úÖ Step 3: Error classes created
  - id: create-test-helper # ‚ùå Step 4: Failed - auto-rollback
  - id: fix-test-helper # ‚úÖ Step 5: Fixed and continued
```

## üèÜ Why Use Spec-Kit Clean Architecture?

1. **Deterministic Development**: Predictable, repeatable results
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated RLHF scoring ensures high quality
3. **Architecture Compliance**: Enforces Clean Architecture principles
4. **Self-Improving**: Learns from mistakes and successes
5. **Safe Refactoring**: Rollback capabilities protect your code
