# Task: Analyze Cross-Artifact Consistency

You are performing a **comprehensive consistency analysis** across all project artifacts to ensure alignment between specifications, plans, tasks, and implementation before proceeding with execution.

## üéØ Analysis Purpose

**Quality Assurance**: Catch inconsistencies before they become implementation problems
**Risk Mitigation**: Identify missing or conflicting requirements
**Architecture Validation**: Ensure Clean Architecture principles are maintained
**Stakeholder Alignment**: Verify all artifacts support the same goals

## üìã Input Processing

**Analysis Scope**: $SCOPE (feature/layer/project/all)
**Target Artifacts**: $ARTIFACTS (optional - if not specified, analyze all relevant artifacts)

2. **Impact Assessment**: How does this affect implementation?
3. **Resolution Strategy**: What's the best way to fix this?
4. **Artifact Updates**: Which documents need updates?
5. **Validation**: How to verify the fix is complete?

### For Each Warning Issue:
1. **Risk Assessment**: What's the likelihood and impact?
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Fix now vs. accept risk?
3. **Mitigation Strategy**: How to minimize risk if not fixed?
4. **Monitoring Plan**: How to watch for problems?

## üìç Next Steps

Based on analysis results:

### If Consistent (Ready for Implementation)
1. **Proceed with**: `/implement from tasks: [TASK-LIST]`
2. **Monitor**: Watch for issues during implementation
3. **Validate**: Confirm implementation matches analysis

### If Inconsistencies Found
1. **Fix Critical Issues**: Update affected artifacts
2. **Re-run Analysis**: Validate fixes resolve issues
3. **Get Stakeholder Approval**: For any requirement changes
4. **Proceed when clean**: Only implement after consistency achieved

The goal is to catch and resolve inconsistencies before they become expensive implementation problems.
