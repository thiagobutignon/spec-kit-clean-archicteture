# Task: Clarify Ambiguous Requirements

You are identifying and resolving **ambiguous, underspecified, or risky areas** in a feature specification before proceeding to implementation planning. This step reduces implementation risks and prevents architectural mistakes.

## üéØ Purpose

**Risk Reduction**: Catch ambiguities before they become expensive implementation problems
**Quality Assurance**: Ensure specifications are clear enough for deterministic implementation
**Stakeholder Alignment**: Verify understanding of business requirements

## üìã Input Processing

**Specification**: Load from `.specify/specs/$SPEC_ID/spec.md`
**Focus Areas**: $AREAS (optional - if not specified, analyze entire specification)

## üîç Clarification Analysis Framework

```

### 4. Performance and Scale Ambiguities

#### Performance Requirements
```markdown
## ‚ö° Performance Analysis

### Response Time Expectations
**Question**: What are the acceptable response times for [operation]?
- **Current Spec**: [What's currently stated]
- **Missing Benchmarks**: [Unstated performance requirements]
- **User Experience Impact**: [How performance affects UX]
- **System Load Scenarios**: [Peak usage considerations]

### Data Volume Handling
**Question**: How much data will this feature handle?
- **Initial Volume**: [Expected starting data size]
- **Growth Projections**: [How data will grow over time]
- **Query Performance**: [Large dataset query requirements]
- **Storage Implications**: [Database design considerations]
```

### 5. Security and Compliance Ambiguities

#### Access Control
```markdown
## üîê Security Analysis

### Authorization Rules
**Question**: Who can perform [action] under what conditions?
- **Current Permissions**: [What's currently specified]
- **Role-Based Access**: [Unclear role boundaries]
- **Contextual Access**: [Situation-dependent permissions]
- **Data Sensitivity**: [Classification and protection levels]

### Audit and Compliance
**Question**: What audit trail is required for [operation]?
- **Regulatory Requirements**: [Legal/compliance needs]
- **Audit Log Details**: [What to log and how]
- **Data Retention**: [How long to keep audit data]
- **Privacy Implications**: [PII handling requirements]
```

## ‚úÖ Clarification Completion Criteria

### All High-Risk Ambiguities Resolved
- [ ] **Architectural decisions** made and documented

- [ ] **Business stakeholders** have reviewed and approved clarifications
- [ ] **Technical team** understands all requirements
- [ ] **Updated specification** reflects all clarifications

## üìÅ Output Files

Create these files in `.specify/specs/[SPEC-ID]/`:

1. **`clarifications.md`** - All identified ambiguities and resolutions
2. **`updated-spec.md`** - Specification updated with clarifications
3. **`stakeholder-decisions.md`** - Business decisions and rationale
4. **`technical-decisions.md`** - Technical approach decisions
5. **`open-questions.md`** - Any remaining questions for later resolution

## üîÑ Iterative Clarification

### Multiple Rounds May Be Needed
1. **Initial Analysis**: Identify obvious ambiguities
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Gather clarifications
3. **Technical Review**: Assess technical implications
4. **Refinement**: Address new questions that arise
5. **Final Validation**: Confirm all critical ambiguities resolved

## üìç Next Steps

After clarification is complete:

1. **Update specification** with all clarifications
2. **Document decisions** and rationale
3. **Proceed to planning**: `/plan from spec: [SPEC-ID]`
4. **Reference clarifications** during implementation

The goal is to have a specification clear enough that implementation planning can proceed without major unknowns or assumptions.
