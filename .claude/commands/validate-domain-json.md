# Task: Validate Domain JSON Plan

## 1. Your Deliverable

Your **only** output for this task is a validation report.

- If the validation passes, the output is a simple JSON object: `{"status": "SUCCESS", "message": "JSON plan is valid and complete."}`.
- If the validation fails, the output is a JSON object detailing the errors: `{"status": "FAILED", "errors": ["error message 1", "error message 2"]}`.

## 2. Objective

Your goal is to act as an automated quality assurance engineer. You will receive a JSON object, which is a plan for generating a domain layer, and you must validate it against a strict set of logical and structural rules.

## 3. Input Parameters

- **JSON Plan:** The JSON object generated by the `/pre-tasks-domain` command.

## 4. Validation Checklist (Rules of Engagement)

You **MUST** validate the input JSON against every rule in this checklist. The validation fails if even one rule is violated.

### A. Schema and Structure Validation

- [ ] **Root Keys:** The root of the JSON object must contain `featureName` (string) and `steps` (array of objects).
- [ ] **Step Keys:** Every object inside the `steps` array must contain `id` (string), `type` (string), `description` (string), and `path` (string).
- [ ] **Step Types:** The `type` for each step must be one of the allowed values: `create_file`, `refactor_file`, `delete_file`, `folder`.
- [ ] **References:** Every step must have a `references` array, and it must not be empty. Each object in the array must have `type`, `source`, and `description`.

### B. Logical Consistency and Completeness

- [ ] **Path Consistency:** The `path` in each step must be consistent with the `featureName`. For example, if `featureName` is "User Account", the path should contain `features/user-account/`.
- [ ] **Template Completeness (`create_file`):**
  - [ ] The `template` key must exist and not be empty.
  - [ ] If the step creates a use case, the `template` must contain placeholders like `__USE_CASE_INPUT_FIELDS__` and `__USE_CASE_OUTPUT_FIELDS__`.
  - [ ] If the step creates a test helper, the `template` must contain `__MOCK_INPUT_DATA__` and `__MOCK_OUTPUT_DATA__`.
- [ ] **Template Correctness (`refactor_file`):**
  - [ ] The `template` key must exist and not be empty.
  - [ ] The `template` string must contain exactly one `<<<REPLACE>>>...<<</REPLACE>>>` block and one `<<<WITH>>>...<<</WITH>>>` block.
- [ ] **Dependency Sanity Check:**
  - [ ] A `refactor_file` or `delete_file` step should not appear before the `create_file` step for the same file. (You can't modify a file that hasn't been created yet).
  - [ ] The `steps` array should generally start with `type: 'folder'` or `type: 'create_file'`.

### C. Content and Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Naming Conventions:** The `name` fields within the JSON (for use cases, errors, etc.) should follow PascalCase. The `id` and `path` should use kebab-case.
- [ ] **Mock Data Presence:** For every use case, there must be a corresponding `create_test-helper` step, and its `mockInput` and `mockOutput` data should not be empty.

## 5. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

1.  **Parse Input:** Receive the JSON plan.
2.  **Iterate Checklist:** Go through every rule in the "Validation Checklist" above.
3.  **Collect Errors:** For each rule that is violated, add a descriptive error message to a list.
4.  **Generate Report:**
    a. If the list of errors is empty, produce the SUCCESS JSON object.
    b. If the list contains any errors, produce the FAILED JSON object, including the list of errors.

## Example Invocation

### Example 1: Valid JSON

`/validate-domain-json from json:`

```json
{
  "featureName": "User Account",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "create-use-case-create-user-account",
      "type": "create_file",
      "description": "...",
      "path": "src/features/user-account/...",
      "references": [
        {
          "type": "external_pattern",
          "source": "context7",
          "description": "..."
        }
      ],
      "template": "export type CreateUserAccountInput = { __USE_CASE_INPUT_FIELDS__ }"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "JSON plan is valid and complete."
}
```

### Example 2: Invalid JSON

`/validate-domain-json from json:`

```json
{
  "featureName": "User Account",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "create-use-case-create-user-account",
      "type": "create_file",
      "description": "...",
      "path": "src/features/some-other-feature/...",
      "references": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "status": "FAILED",
  "errors": [
    "Path inconsistency: The path 'src/features/some-other-feature/...' does not match the featureName 'User Account'.",
    "Missing references: The 'references' array for step 'create-use-case-create-user-account' cannot be empty."
  ]
}
```
