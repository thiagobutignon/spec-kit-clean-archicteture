## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Automated Commit Convention** (#179)
  - Standardized all Regent automated commits to use `regent` conventional commit type
  - Added `regent` to ConventionalCommitType enum in commit-generator.ts
  - Updated all type mappings to use `regent` instead of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.
  - Benefits:
    - Easy identification: `git log --grep="^regent"` shows only automated commits
    - Clear git history: instant distinction between AI-generated and manual code
    - Bulk operations: revert or analyze all Regent commits at once
    - CI/CD integration: skip automated commits in workflows
  - Added `.commitlintrc.json` to validate both `regent` and standard commit types
  - Updated README.md with commit convention documentation
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to clarify `regent` type is for automated commits only
  - All 46 tests updated and passing

### Planning for v2.4.0

**Breakthrough: Deterministic AI Development Methodology**

This release represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development. The system successfully "ate its own dog food" by refactoring itself using its own deterministic methodology.

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-02

> **Release Focus**: Self-Refactoring, Namespace Pollution Fixes, and Deterministic AI Development

**ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone: The System Successfully Refactored Itself**

The Regent achieved true dogfooding by refactoring its own 2000-line monolithic `execute-steps.ts` into proper Clean Architecture using its deterministic methodology. This proves the system works at scale.

### Added

- **AI-Deterministic Development Documentation** (1,416 lines)
  - Revolutionary approach: AI for creativity, systems for execution
  - Complete analysis of vibe coding vs deterministic development
  - Role of Serena MCP (15-20x faster code discovery)
  - RLHF automated feedback loops
  - 5-phase workflow diagrams
  - Real-world case study: execute-steps.ts refactoring (50 steps)
  - Comparison table: Traditional LLM vs Deterministic approach
  - **Table of Contents** for easy navigation (49 sections)
  - File: `docs/ai-deterministic-development.md`

- **Dogfooding Artifacts Documentation**
  - Complete README explaining refactoring artifacts
  - Success metrics and timeline
  - Learning guide for users, contributors, and researchers
  - Reproducibility instructions
  - Case study highlights (namespace pollution bug)
  - File: `docs/dogfooding/README.md`

- **Dogfooding Test Suite**
  - Validates generated code structure (dog/src)
  - Validates refactored code functionality (src/)
  - Tests RLHF system completeness
  - 5-step test template for rapid validation
  - Files: `scripts/test-dogfooding.ts`, `dog/test-dogfood-simple.regent`

- **Self-Refactoring Implementation** (50 steps)
  - Refactored execute-steps.ts (2000 lines) â†’ Clean Architecture
  - Generated 50 files across 6 layers (domain, data, infra, presentation, validation, main)
  - 18 commits with automated quality checks
  - RLHF score: 2/2 (perfect execution)
  - File: `dog/implement-executor.regent`

- **Future Enhancement Issues**
  - #171: Integrate Auditor library for code quality
  - #172: SWE-bench TypeScript benchmark with deterministic methodology
  - #173: Improve logger output for better visibility
  - #174: Non-interactive execution mode for AI orchestration
  - #175: Extract test directory patterns for complete coverage
  - #176: Vertical Slice / Feature-based architecture evolution

### Fixed

- **Namespace Pollution from zx/globals** - CRITICAL BUG
  - Problem: `import 'zx/globals'` polluted namespace with zx's `fs` object
  - Conflicted with `fs-extra` imports causing `fs.readFile is not a function`
  - Solution: Changed to explicit imports `import { $, chalk, argv } from 'zx'`
  - Files fixed:
    - `src/execute-steps.ts`
    - `src/core/rlhf-system.ts`
    - `src/utils/git-operations.ts`
    - `src/utils/package-manager.ts`
  - Commits: 11b380b, 6e2b66d, 1460bbd

- **ESM Import Compatibility for fs-extra**
  - Problem: `import * as fs from 'fs-extra'` doesn't work in ESM/tsx context
  - Solution: Changed to default import `import fs from 'fs-extra'`
  - Alternative pattern: `import fsExtra from 'fs-extra'; const fs = fsExtra`
  - Files fixed:
    - `src/core/rlhf-system.ts` (f361eeb)
    - `src/execute-steps.ts` (9c7794e)

- **RLHF Analysis Error on Step Failure**
  - Bug only manifested when steps FAILED (not on success)
  - Root cause: Namespace pollution + ESM import issues
  - Fixed by addressing both import problems above
  - RLHF system now completes analysis correctly

### Changed

- **Execute Steps Architecture** - Major Refactoring
  - From: 2000-line monolithic file
  - To: 50 files following Clean Architecture
  - Layers: domain (12 files), data (18 files), infra (8 files), presentation (4 files), main (7 files), validation (1 file)
  - All quality checks passing (lint, tests, TypeScript compilation)
  - 100% deterministic execution via regent system

### Technical Deep Dive

**The Namespace Pollution Bug:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
import 'zx/globals';  // Injects zx's fs into global namespace
import * as fs from 'fs-extra';  // Creates namespace conflict

// AFTER (fixed):
import fsExtra from 'fs-extra';
import { $, chalk, argv } from 'zx';
const fs = fsExtra;  // No conflicts
```

**Why This Matters:**
- zx's `fs` is a minimal subset of Node.js fs
- fs-extra extends Node.js fs with promise methods
- Namespace pollution caused zx's `fs` to shadow fs-extra
- `fs.readFile` failed because zx's `fs` doesn't have that method

**The Discovery Process:**
1. Used Serena MCP to analyze all fs imports across codebase
2. Used Context7 to research zx documentation
3. Found zx exports its own `fs` that conflicts
4. Discovered ESM requires default import for fs-extra

**Dogfooding Success Metrics:**
- âœ… Generated code structure validated
- âœ… Refactored code executes correctly
- âœ… RLHF system operational
- âœ… Namespace pollution eliminated
- âœ… All 50 steps executed successfully
- âœ… 18 commits with quality validation
